This module is designed to be a completely self-contained manager for
[Steam trade offers](https://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers).

Instead of being just a simple API wrapper, it's designed to take most of the work out of implementing trade offers in
your application.

**You absolutely need Node.js v4.0.0 or later or this won't work.**

Install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-tradeoffer-manager) or check out the
[wiki](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager/wiki) for documentation.
